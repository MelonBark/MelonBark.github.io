            <h3>
                When our founder Mark Noble started the company, he found that only 30 percent of area businesses had websites.  Many of the sites he surveyed had a cookie-cutter experience that limits the effectiveness of their online presence.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                After speaking with numerous area business owners in the area, he found that their websites were built on old, inflexible technologies that made it far too expensive to keep updated.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                Worse yet, many were paying incredibly unreasonable prices for hosting and other add-ons they weren't even be able to use.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                One business Mark helped early on had been locked out of their site for two years because of a hacking attack - but they were still being billed by the same host that locked their site, making it unusable.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                Here at Melon Bark, we have a vision for local Internet that helps businesses and their customers connect - without spending a small fortune on advertising just to keep customers coming in the door.
            </h3>
            <h3>

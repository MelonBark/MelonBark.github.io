    <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective date: December 17, 2022</p>
    <p>This Cookie Policy explains how Melon Bark, LLC and its affiliates ("us", "we", or "our") use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>
    <h2>What are cookies</h2>
    <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
    <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Melon Bark, LLC) are called "first-party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>
    <h2>Why we use cookies</h2>
    <p>We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our website. Third parties serve cookies through our website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.</p>
    <h2>Types of cookies we use</h2>
    <p>The types of cookies we use can be classified into the categories described below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Essential cookies: These cookies are essential for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.</li>
        <li>Performance cookies: These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources, so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.</li>
        <li>Functionality cookies: These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies, then some or all of these services may not function properly.</li>
        <li>Targeting cookies: These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant ads on other sites. They do not store directly personal information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Third-party cookies</h2>
    <p>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant ads about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may also use cookies to track the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns. We do not have access to or control over these cookies.</p>
    <h2>How to control cookies</h2>
    <p>You can control and manage cookies in several ways. Please keep in mind that removing or blocking cookies may impact your user experience and some features of our website may no longer be available.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Most browsers allow you to refuse or accept cookies. You can block cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. To learn more about how to do this, visit the help pages of your browser.</li>
        <li>You can also opt out of being tracked by some third-party advertising cookies through the Network Advertising Initiative's opt-out page (http://optout.networkadvertising.org/) or the Digital Advertising Alliance's opt-out page (http://optout.aboutads.info/).</li>
    </ul>
